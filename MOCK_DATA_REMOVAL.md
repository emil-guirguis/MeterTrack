# Mock Data Removal Documentation

## Overview

This document summarizes the removal of all mock/fake/sample data generation from the facility management application, replacing it with real API service integrations.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

#### System Health Component (`src/components/system/SystemHealth.tsx`)
- **Before**: Generated fake health status, metrics, and service data
- **After**: Makes real API calls to:
  - `/api/threading/health` - Database and service health
  - `/api/threading/status` - Threading service status
  - `/api/threading/stats` - System metrics and statistics
- **Impact**: Now displays real-time system monitoring data

#### Template Management Components
- **TemplateForm.tsx**: Removed mock variable generation, now calls `templateService.getAvailableVariables()`
- **TemplatePreview.tsx**: Removed fake sample data generation, uses backend-provided samples only
- **TemplateAnalytics.tsx**: Replaced mock statistics with real API calls to template service
- **TemplateList.tsx**: Removed simulated template data, now fetches from real template service

#### Store Layer (`src/store/entities/`)
- **templatesStore.ts**: Migrated from mock dataset to `templateService` API calls
- **equipmentStore.ts**: Switched from fake equipment data to real `equipmentService` integration
- **contactsStore.ts**: Replaced mock contacts with real `contactService` API calls

#### Service Layer
- **Created `equipmentService.ts`**: New service for real equipment API integration
- **Updated `templateService.ts`**: Removed unused mock-related imports
- **Enhanced API error handling**: All services now use proper error handling with token refresh

#### Utility Functions (`src/utils/`)
- **utils.ts**: Removed `generateRandomId()` function that created fake IDs
- **syncManager.ts**: Removed simulated network delays and artificial failure simulation
- **errorHandler.ts**: Converted enum to const object for better TypeScript compatibility

#### Email Configuration (`src/components/settings/EmailConfigForm.tsx`)
- **Before**: Simulated test email sending with fake success/failure
- **After**: Removed test simulation - real email testing should be done through backend API

## API Endpoints Now Used

The application now integrates with these real backend endpoints:

- `/api/templates/*` - Email template management
- `/api/equipment/*` - Equipment/meter management  
- `/api/contacts/*` - Customer and vendor contact management
- `/api/threading/health` - System health monitoring
- `/api/threading/status` - Service status checks
- `/api/threading/stats` - System metrics and statistics

## Configuration Notes

### Backend Requirements
- Ensure backend server is running on port 3001 (or update `VITE_API_BASE_URL`)
- Database should be properly configured with real data
- SMTP settings required for email functionality

### Authentication
- All API calls now use proper authentication tokens
- Token refresh is handled automatically on 401 responses
- Tokens stored in localStorage/sessionStorage as fallback

### Error Handling
- Real API errors are now properly handled and displayed to users
- Network issues show appropriate error messages
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Testing Recommendations

1. **System Health**: Verify health dashboard shows real service status
2. **Template Management**: Test template CRUD operations with backend
3. **Equipment Management**: Ensure equipment data loads from database
4. **Contact Management**: Verify customer/vendor operations work properly
5. **Email System**: Test email sending through configured SMTP

## Breaking Changes

- Mock data will no longer be available during development
- Backend services must be running for full functionality
- Database must contain actual data for meaningful testing
- Email templates require real variable definitions from backend

## Rollback Information

If issues arise, mock data implementations can be temporarily restored by:
1. Reverting store files to use mock datasets
2. Re-adding mock data generation in component files
3. Restoring simulated delays in sync manager

However, it's recommended to fix any backend/database issues rather than reverting to mock data.
