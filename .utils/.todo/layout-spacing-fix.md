# Layout Spacing Issue - Summary

## Original Issue
White space visible on both left and right sides of the application layout.

## Root Cause
The layout uses a fixed sidebar (280px wide) that sits on the left. The header and content need to account for this fixed sidebar width.

## Current State After Changes
- Sidebar taking too much space
- Header too big
- Original white space issue still present

## What Needs to Happen
1. Revert all recent changes to get back to a working baseline
2. The actual fix needed is simpler: just ensure the content area properly accounts for the fixed sidebar

## Files Modified (need to revert)
- client/frontend/src/index.css
- framework/frontend/layout/components/AppLayout.css  
- framework/frontend/layout/components/Header.css
- framework/frontend/shared/components/EntityManagementPage.css (new file created)

## Correct Approach
The layout already has the right structure with:
- Fixed sidebar on left (280px or 64px collapsed)
- Content area with margin-left to account for sidebar
- This is the correct pattern and shouldn't be changed

The white space issue is likely coming from somewhere else - possibly browser dev tools, zoom level, or a parent container we haven't identified yet.
