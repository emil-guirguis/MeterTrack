# Production Readiness Checklist

This document outlines the steps and considerations for deploying the MCP Threading System to production.

## ðŸ”§ Pre-Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Copy `.env.threading.example` to `.env.threading`
- [ ] Update `JWT_SECRET` with a secure 32+ character string
- [ ] Set `MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD` to a strong password
- [ ] Configure `FRONTEND_URL` with your actual frontend domain(s)
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Review and adjust threading configuration parameters

### Security Configuration
- [ ] Change default MongoDB credentials
- [ ] Configure firewall rules (only expose necessary ports)
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS
- [ ] Configure rate limiting appropriately for your use case
- [ ] Review CORS settings in `FRONTEND_URL`

### Resource Configuration
- [ ] Set appropriate memory limits (`WORKER_MAX_MEMORY_MB`)
- [ ] Configure database connection pool size (`DB_POOL_SIZE`)
- [ ] Adjust health check intervals based on your requirements
- [ ] Set appropriate restart limits and timeouts

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. System Requirements
- Docker 20.10+ and Docker Compose 2.0+
- Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB+ recommended)
- Minimum 10GB disk space
- Network access to MongoDB and Modbus devices

### 2. Initial Deployment
```bash
# Linux/macOS
./deploy-threading.sh deploy

# Windows
deploy-threading.bat deploy
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check service status
./deploy-threading.sh status

# Run health checks
./deploy-threading.sh health

# Check threading system
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/threading/status | jq
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Setup

### Health Monitoring
- [ ] Configure health check endpoints in your load balancer
- [ ] Set up external monitoring (Pingdom, UptimeRobot, etc.)
- [ ] Configure alerting for service failures

### Application Monitoring
- [ ] Enable Prometheus metrics export (`ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_EXPORT=true`)
- [ ] Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization
- [ ] Configure log aggregation (ELK stack, Splunk, etc.)
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.)

### Threading System Monitoring
The system includes built-in monitoring for:
- Worker thread health and status
- Memory usage and limits
- Message queue performance
- Error rates and recovery
- Resource cleanup effectiveness

## ðŸ”’ Security Hardening

### Container Security
- [ ] Run containers as non-root user (already configured)
- [ ] Use minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- [ ] Regularly update base images and dependencies
- [ ] Scan images for vulnerabilities

### Network Security
- [ ] Use Docker networks for service isolation
- [ ] Configure firewall rules (UFW, iptables, etc.)
- [ ] Set up reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik) with SSL
- [ ] Implement network segmentation

### Application Security
- [ ] Enable helmet.js security headers (already configured)
- [ ] Configure rate limiting appropriately
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Regular security audits and penetration testing

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Configure MongoDB indexes for your queries
- [ ] Set up MongoDB replica set for high availability
- [ ] Configure appropriate connection pool sizes
- [ ] Monitor database performance metrics

### Threading System Optimization
- [ ] Tune memory limits based on actual usage
- [ ] Adjust health check intervals for your requirements
- [ ] Configure message queue sizes appropriately
- [ ] Monitor and tune garbage collection settings

### Caching Strategy
- [ ] Enable Redis caching if needed
- [ ] Configure appropriate cache TTLs
- [ ] Implement cache warming strategies
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rates

## ðŸ”„ Backup and Recovery

### Database Backup
- [ ] Set up automated MongoDB backups
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedures
- [ ] Configure backup retention policies
- [ ] Store backups in secure, off-site location

### Configuration Backup
- [ ] Version control all configuration files
- [ ] Document configuration changes
- [ ] Maintain rollback procedures
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures

## ðŸ“‹ Operational Procedures

### Deployment Process
1. Test changes in staging environment
2. Create deployment checklist
3. Schedule maintenance window
4. Deploy using deployment scripts
5. Verify all health checks pass
6. Monitor system for 24-48 hours

### Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] Set up 24/7 monitoring
- [ ] Configure escalation procedures
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures
- [ ] Train operations team

### Maintenance Tasks
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Log rotation and cleanup
- [ ] Performance monitoring and tuning
- [ ] Capacity planning and scaling

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Threading System Not Starting
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.threading.yml logs backend

# Check threading status
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/threading/status
```

#### High Memory Usage
```bash
# Check memory metrics
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/threading/stats | jq '.performance'

# Trigger garbage collection
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/threading/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "gc", "priority": "high"}'
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check MongoDB status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.threading.yml exec mongodb mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"

# Check connection pool
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/health | jq '.database'
```

### Log Locations
- Application logs: `./logs/threading.log`
- Container logs: `docker-compose logs [service]`
- System logs: `/var/log/` (Linux) or Event Viewer (Windows)

### Performance Metrics
- Threading status: `GET /api/threading/status`
- Health metrics: `GET /api/threading/health`
- Performance stats: `GET /api/threading/stats`
- Prometheus metrics: `GET /metrics` (if enabled)

## ðŸ“ž Support and Escalation

### Internal Escalation
1. Check automated monitoring alerts
2. Review application logs and metrics
3. Escalate to development team if needed
4. Document incidents for post-mortem

### External Support
- MongoDB Atlas support (if using managed MongoDB)
- Cloud provider support (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Container orchestration support (if using Kubernetes)
