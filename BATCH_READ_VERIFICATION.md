# Batch Read Implementation Verification

## Summary
✅ **All registers ARE being read in a single batch per meter** (not split across multiple batches under normal conditions).

## How It Works

### 1. Batch Size Configuration
- `BatchSizeManager` is initialized with default config: `initialBatchSize: 'all'`
- When `getBatchSize(meterId, totalRegisters)` is called, it returns `totalRegisters`
- This means if a meter has 50 registers, the batch size is 50

### 2. Batch Read Flow
```
For each meter:
  1. Get all configured registers from cache (e.g., 50 registers)
  2. Create batch read requests for all 50 registers
  3. Call performBatchReadWithAdaptiveSizing()
  4. Get batch size from manager: 50 (all of them)
  5. Loop: i = 0 to 50, step 50
     - First iteration: reads registers 0-50 in ONE batch request
     - Loop ends (no more iterations)
  6. All 50 registers read in a single readPropertyMultiple() call
```

### 3. Adaptive Sizing (Only on Timeout)
If a batch read times out:
- Batch size is reduced by 50% (configurable)
- The batch is retried with the smaller size
- This allows the system to adapt to slow devices

Example with timeout:
```
Initial batch size: 50 registers
Batch read times out
→ Reduce to 25 registers
→ Retry with 25 registers
→ If successful, continue with batch size 25
```

### 4. Sequential Fallback (Only on Complete Failure)
If a batch read fails completely (not just timeout):
- Fall back to reading registers one at a time
- This ensures we get as many readings as possible
- Logged as recovery method: 'sequential'

## Log Output
When batch reads are working correctly, you should see:
```
📦 Starting batch read for meter 1: ✅ Reading ALL 50 registers in batch size 50
📋 Batch 1: Reading registers 1-50 (batch size: 50)
✅ Batch 1 completed successfully for meter 1
📊 Batch read completed for meter 1: 50 succeeded, 0 failed
```

If batch is being split (due to previous timeout):
```
📦 Starting batch read for meter 1: ⚠️ Reading in chunks 50 registers in batch size 25
📋 Batch 1: Reading registers 1-25 (batch size: 25)
📋 Batch 2: Reading registers 26-50 (batch size: 25)
```

## Configuration
To change batch size behavior, pass `batchSizeConfig` to `CollectionCycleManager`:

```typescript
const config: BatchSizeConfig = {
  initialBatchSize: 'all',      // Read all registers at once (default)
  minBatchSize: 1,              // Minimum batch size before sequential (default)
  reductionFactor: 0.5,         // Reduce by 50% on timeout (default)
};

const manager = new CollectionCycleManager(
  deviceRegisterCache,
  logger,
  config  // Pass config here
);
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Batch reads are configured correctly
- ✅ All registers read in single batch (unless timeout occurs)
- ✅ Adaptive sizing handles slow devices
- ✅ Sequential fallback for complete failures
- ✅ Metrics tracking for monitoring
