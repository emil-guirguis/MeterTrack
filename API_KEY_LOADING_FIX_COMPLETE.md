# API Key Loading Fix - Complete

## Problem
The `ClientSystemApiClient.testConnection()` method had a blank API key when called by `ConnectivityMonitor`, causing connectivity tests to fail.

## Root Cause
**Race condition in initialization order:**

1. `RemoteToLocalSyncAgent.start()` was called and began syncing tenants asynchronously
2. Immediately after, the code tried to load the API key from the database
3. But the tenant sync hadn't completed yet, so the database was still empty
4. The API key remained blank
5. When `ConnectivityMonitor` called `testConnection()`, the API key was still blank

## Solution
Modified `sync/mcp/src/index.ts` to **wait for the initial tenant sync to complete** before loading the API key:

### Changes Made

1. **Added `waitForTenantSync()` helper method** (lines 243-258)
   - Polls the database for up to 5 seconds
   - Checks if tenant data with API key is available
   - Returns immediately when API key is found
   - Logs a warning if timeout occurs but proceeds anyway

2. **Updated initialization order** (lines 145-175)
   - Start RemoteToLocalSyncAgent
   - **Wait for tenant sync to complete** (NEW)
   - Load API key from database (now guaranteed to have data)
   - Create ClientSystemApiClient with loaded key
   - Start SyncManager

### Initialization Flow (After Fix)

```
1. Initialize database pools
2. Initialize RemoteToLocalSyncAgent
3. Start RemoteToLocalSyncAgent (begins tenant sync)
4. ⏳ WAIT for tenant sync to complete (polls database)
5. Load API key from database (now available)
6. Create ClientSystemApiClient with API key
7. Start SyncManager
8. Start Local API Server
```

## Result
- API key is now guaranteed to be loaded before `testConnection()` is called
- Connectivity tests will have the correct API key
- No more blank API key errors in logs

## Files Modified
- `sync/mcp/src/index.ts` - Added wait logic and helper method
