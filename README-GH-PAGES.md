This repository contains a Vite React frontend in `responsive-web-app` for the MeterIt project.

GitHub Pages deploy

- The GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml` builds the frontend and publishes the `responsive-web-app/dist` directory to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`.

How it works

1. The workflow checks out the repo, installs Node.js, runs `npm ci` in `responsive-web-app`, builds the app (`npm run build`) and publishes `responsive-web-app/dist` using the official Pages actions.

If you need a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file to `responsive-web-app/dist` during build (or add it to the repo root and copy in a build step).

Smoke test

The workflow includes a smoke-test step that pings the published Pages URL after deployment and fails the workflow if the site doesn't respond with an HTTP 200 within ~2 minutes. You can also run the workflow manually via the Actions tab.

Default Pages URL after deployment:

https://emil-guirguis.github.io/facility-management-app/  
(If you want the URL to show the new name `meterit` in the path, you can rename the repository on GitHub to `meterit` â€” Pages URL follows the repo name.)
