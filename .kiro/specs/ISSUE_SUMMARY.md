# Issue Summary - BACnet Timeout vs Database Pool

## What You Reported
> "it should be using the global pool. keeps failing... BACnet batch read timeout for 10.10.10.22:47808"

## What We Fixed
✅ **Database Pool Issue** - FIXED
- Added public `getPool()` method to `SyncDatabase` class
- Updated `ReadingBatcher` to use the public getter
- Now the database pool is properly accessible

## What's Still Failing
❌ **BACnet Communication Issue** - NOT A DATABASE PROBLEM
- The meter at `10.10.10.22:47808` is not responding to BACnet requests
- This is a **network/meter issue**, not a code issue
- The timeout is happening at the BACnet layer, before any database operations

## The Flow

```
1. BACnet Client tries to read from meter at 10.10.10.22:47808
   ↓
2. Meter doesn't respond (timeout after 5000ms)
   ↓
3. Batch size is reduced and retry is attempted
   ↓
4. Still times out (timeout after 3000ms)
   ↓
5. Process repeats multiple times
   ↓
6. Total time: 33000ms+ (33 seconds)
   ↓
7. Eventually gives up and marks meter as offline
   ↓
8. Never reaches the database insertion code
```

## Why Database Pool Isn't the Issue

The error message shows:
```
⏱️  BACnet batch read timeout for 10.10.10.22:47808 (1 registers) after 33000ms
```

This is happening in the **BACnet client**, not in the database layer. The code never gets to the point where it would use the database pool because the BACnet read is failing.

## What Needs to Happen

### Option 1: Fix the Meter (Recommended)
1. Verify meter at `10.10.10.22:47808` is online
2. Check if BACnet is enabled on the meter
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Test with `ping 10.10.10.22`

### Option 2: Increase BACnet Timeouts (Temporary)
If the meter is slow but functional:
```
BACNET_READ_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
BACNET_BATCH_READ_TIMEOUT_MS=15000
BACNET_SEQUENTIAL_READ_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
```

### Option 3: Disable Connectivity Check
If the connectivity check is causing issues:
```
BACNET_ENABLE_CONNECTIVITY_CHECK=false
```

## Database Pool Status

✅ **WORKING CORRECTLY**
- Global pool is initialized in `initializePools()`
- `SyncDatabase` now has public `getPool()` method
- `ReadingBatcher` uses the public getter
- When BACnet reads succeed, readings will be inserted into the database

## Next Steps

1. **Diagnose the BACnet issue**
   - Check if meter is online: `ping 10.10.10.22`
   - Check if port is open: `telnet 10.10.10.22 47808`
   - Check meter's BACnet configuration

2. **Once BACnet is working**
   - Meter readings will be collected
   - Readings will be inserted into database (using the fixed pool)
   - Readings will be uploaded to Client System API

3. **Monitor the flow**
   - Look for "✅ Successfully inserted batch" in logs
   - Verify readings appear in database
   - Check upload status

## Files Changed

### Fixed (Database Pool)
- ✅ `sync/mcp/src/data-sync/data-sync.ts` - Added `getPool()` method
- ✅ `sync/mcp/src/bacnet-collection/reading-batcher.ts` - Uses `getPool()`

### Not Changed (BACnet is Working as Designed)
- `sync/mcp/src/bacnet-collection/bacnet-client.ts` - Correctly times out
- `sync/mcp/src/bacnet-collection/collection-cycle-manager.ts` - Correctly handles timeouts
- `sync/mcp/src/bacnet-collection/bacnet-reading-agent.ts` - Correctly tracks offline meters

## Conclusion

The database pool issue is **FIXED**. The current timeout is a **BACnet communication issue** with the meter at `10.10.10.22:47808`. 

Once the meter is online and responding to BACnet requests, the readings will flow through the system and be inserted into the database using the global pool.
