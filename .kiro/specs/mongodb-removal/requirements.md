# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The system currently has a confusing dual-database setup with both MongoDB and PostgreSQL components. This creates unnecessary complexity, maintenance overhead, and potential data consistency issues. The goal is to completely remove all MongoDB logic and dependencies, standardizing on PostgreSQL as the single database solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to work with a single database technology (PostgreSQL) so that the system is simpler to understand, maintain, and deploy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL only connect to PostgreSQL databases
2. WHEN developers review the codebase THEN they SHALL find no MongoDB-related code, imports, or dependencies
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL not attempt to connect to any MongoDB instances
4. WHEN package.json is reviewed THEN it SHALL not contain mongoose or mongodb dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all data operations to use PostgreSQL so that I only need to manage one database system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is created, read, updated, or deleted THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL exclusively
2. WHEN migration scripts are executed THEN they SHALL only target PostgreSQL tables
3. WHEN database connections are established THEN they SHALL only be PostgreSQL connections
4. WHEN backup and maintenance operations are performed THEN they SHALL only involve PostgreSQL

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean file structure without MongoDB artifacts so that the project is easier to navigate and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project directory is reviewed THEN it SHALL not contain any .mongodb.js files
2. WHEN model files are examined THEN they SHALL not use mongoose schemas
3. WHEN service files are reviewed THEN they SHALL not import or reference MongoDB libraries
4. WHEN configuration files are checked THEN they SHALL not contain MongoDB connection strings or settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing PostgreSQL functionality to remain intact so that current features continue to work after MongoDB removal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing PostgreSQL-based features are tested THEN they SHALL continue to function correctly
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return expected responses using PostgreSQL data
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL use proper PostgreSQL syntax and connections
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL start successfully without MongoDB dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive cleanup of build and deployment scripts so that they don't reference MongoDB components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build scripts are executed THEN they SHALL not attempt to install MongoDB dependencies
2. WHEN deployment scripts run THEN they SHALL not configure MongoDB connections
3. WHEN environment files are reviewed THEN they SHALL not contain MongoDB-related variables
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the PostgreSQL-only architecture
