# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Modbus meter tracking application that captures data from meters over TCP/IP using an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and stores the collected data in a database through API endpoints. The system will provide real-time monitoring and data collection capabilities for industrial meters using the Modbus protocol.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Modbus meter connections, so that the system can communicate with multiple meters over TCP/IP.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides meter configuration (IP address, port, unit ID, register addresses) THEN the system SHALL validate and store the configuration
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL attempt to establish connections to all configured meters
3. IF a meter connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry connection with exponential backoff
4. WHEN a meter is successfully connected THEN the system SHALL mark it as active and begin data collection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a monitoring operator, I want the system to continuously read data from Modbus meters, so that I can track real-time meter values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a meter is connected THEN the system SHALL read configured registers at specified intervals (default 30 seconds)
2. WHEN reading Modbus registers THEN the system SHALL handle both holding registers and input registers
3. IF a read operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with the next scheduled read
4. WHEN data is successfully read THEN the system SHALL timestamp the data and prepare it for storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want meter data to be stored in a database through API endpoints, so that I can analyze historical trends and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN meter data is collected THEN the system SHALL format it according to the API specification
2. WHEN sending data to the API THEN the system SHALL include meter identification, timestamp, register values, and data quality indicators
3. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL queue the data for retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN data is successfully stored THEN the system SHALL log the transaction and remove it from the retry queue

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to interact with the meter data through MCP tools, so that I can query current values and historical data programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client requests current meter values THEN the server SHALL return the latest readings for specified meters
2. WHEN an MCP client requests meter status THEN the server SHALL return connection status and last successful read time
3. WHEN an MCP client requests to add a new meter THEN the server SHALL validate the configuration and add it to the system
4. IF an MCP client provides invalid parameters THEN the server SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log appropriate information with timestamps
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including context
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL log startup sequence and configuration validation
4. WHEN connections are established or lost THEN the system SHALL log connection state changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be configurable and maintainable, so that it can be easily deployed and updated in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables or config files
2. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without full restart
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL validate all required configuration parameters
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail to start
