# Dashboard Email Attachment Fix - Complete

## Problem
The email button on the dashboard card was failing with "Invalid token" error when trying to send emails with CSV attachments. The issue was that:

1. Frontend was sending FormData with multipart/form-data content type
2. Backend endpoint expected `req.file` from multer middleware (which wasn't configured)
3. The endpoint couldn't parse the multipart data properly

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (client/backend/src/routes/emails.js)

Updated the `/api/emails/send-with-attachment` endpoint to:
- Accept JSON body instead of multipart FormData
- Receive file content as base64-encoded string (`fileBase64` field)
- Convert base64 to Buffer for email attachment
- Properly validate all required fields (subject, filename, fileContent/fileBase64)
- Send email with attachment using EmailService

**Key changes:**
- Removed dependency on multer middleware
- Changed from `req.file` to `req.body.fileBase64`
- Added support for both `fileContent` (string) and `fileBase64` (base64 encoded)
- Improved error messages for debugging

### Frontend Changes (framework/frontend/dashboards/components/DashboardCard.tsx)

Updated the `handleEmailClick` function to:
- Generate CSV content from aggregated values
- Encode CSV as base64 using `btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(csvContent)))`
- Send JSON request with base64-encoded file content
- Include proper headers: `Content-Type: application/json` and `Authorization: Bearer {token}`

**Key changes:**
- Changed from FormData to JSON body
- Added base64 encoding of CSV content
- Simplified request headers (no need for multipart boundary)
- Better error handling and user feedback

## How It Works

1. User clicks email button on dashboard card
2. Frontend generates CSV from aggregated data
3. CSV is base64-encoded
4. JSON request sent to `/api/emails/send-with-attachment` with:
   - `subject`: Email subject line
   - `body`: Email body text
   - `filename`: CSV filename
   - `fileBase64`: Base64-encoded CSV content
5. Backend receives request, decodes base64 to Buffer
6. EmailService sends email with CSV attachment to user's email
7. User receives email with CSV file attached

## Testing

To test the email functionality:

1. Start the backend server: `npm run dev` (from client/backend)
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev` (from client/frontend)
3. Navigate to the Dashboard page
4. Click the email button (envelope icon) on any dashboard card
5. Check your email for the CSV attachment

## Files Modified

- `client/backend/src/routes/emails.js` - Updated `/api/emails/send-with-attachment` endpoint
- `framework/frontend/dashboards/components/DashboardCard.tsx` - Updated `handleEmailClick` function

## Notes

- The export button (download) was already working correctly
- Both buttons use Material Icons (FileDownloadIcon and EmailIcon)
- Buttons are positioned in the card header next to edit and delete buttons
- Email is sent to the authenticated user's email address
- CSV attachment includes all aggregated values from the card data
