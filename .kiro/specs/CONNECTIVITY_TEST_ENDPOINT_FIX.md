# Connectivity Test Endpoint Fix

## Problem
The `testConnection()` method was trying to hit `/health` endpoint which doesn't exist in the Client API, causing the connectivity monitor to always report "disconnected".

## Root Cause
The Client API doesn't have a `/health` endpoint. The available endpoints for connectivity testing are:
- `/api/sync/heartbeat` - POST endpoint designed for heartbeat/connectivity checks
- `/api/threading/health` - GET endpoint for threading system health

## Solution
Changed the `testConnection()` method to use the `/sync/heartbeat` endpoint which is:
1. **Designed for connectivity testing** - It's specifically meant for heartbeat checks
2. **Requires authentication** - Uses the API key, ensuring proper authentication
3. **Returns 200 on success** - Indicates the Client API is reachable and authenticated

## Changes Made

### Updated `sync/mcp/src/api/client-system-api.ts`

Changed from:
```typescript
async testConnection(): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const response = await this.client.get('/health', {
      timeout: 5000,
    });
    return response.status === 200;
  } catch (error) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

To:
```typescript
async testConnection(): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const url = `${this.client.defaults.baseURL}/heartbeat`;
    console.log(`🔍 [ClientSystemApiClient] Testing connection to: ${url}`);
    
    // Use the heartbeat endpoint which is designed for connectivity testing
    const response = await this.client.post('/heartbeat', {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    }, {
      timeout: 5000,
    });
    console.log(`✅ [ClientSystemApiClient] Connection successful - Status: ${response.status}`);
    return response.status === 200;
  } catch (error) {
    const axiosError = error as any;
    console.error(`❌ [ClientSystemApiClient] Connection failed:`, {
      message: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
      code: axiosError?.code,
      status: axiosError?.response?.status,
      statusText: axiosError?.response?.statusText,
      baseURL: this.client.defaults.baseURL,
      endpoint: '/heartbeat',
      fullURL: `${this.client.defaults.baseURL}/heartbeat`,
      responseData: axiosError?.response?.data,
    });
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Correct Endpoint**: Uses `/sync/heartbeat` which actually exists in the Client API
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Shows the exact URL being tested and detailed error information
3. **Proper Authentication**: Sends the API key with the request
4. **Timestamp**: Includes timestamp in the heartbeat payload as expected by the endpoint
5. **Better Error Details**: Logs status code, response data, and other debugging info

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **On Startup**: Connectivity Monitor performs initial check using `/sync/heartbeat`
2. **Success**: If Client API is running and API key is valid, returns `true`
3. **Failure**: If Client API is down or API key is invalid, returns `false` with detailed error logs
4. **Logs**: Backend logs show:
   - `🔍 [ClientSystemApiClient] Testing connection to: http://localhost:3001/api/heartbeat`
   - `✅ [ClientSystemApiClient] Connection successful - Status: 200` (on success)
   - `❌ [ClientSystemApiClient] Connection failed: {...}` (on failure with details)

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. **Check logs** for the heartbeat endpoint being tested
2. **Verify API key** is set in `.env`:
   ```env
   CLIENT_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
   CLIENT_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   ```
3. **Ensure Client API is running** on port 3001
4. **Check frontend** - System Connection card should show "Connected" (green)
