# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dashboard currently has excessive padding on the left and right sides, preventing it from utilizing the full available space from the navigation sidebar to the edge of the page. This creates a cramped viewing experience, especially for the wide meter readings table that needs horizontal scrolling. The dashboard should fill the entire content area to maximize data visibility and improve user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want the dashboard to fill the entire available width from the navigation sidebar to the edge of the page, so that I can view more data without unnecessary white space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the content SHALL extend from the navigation sidebar to the right edge of the browser window
2. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN the dashboard SHALL expand to fill the additional space
3. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the dashboard SHALL maintain full width utilization
4. WHEN the meter readings table is displayed THEN it SHALL have maximum available width for better data visibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing meter readings, I want the data table to have maximum horizontal space available, so that I can see more columns without excessive scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the meter readings table is displayed THEN it SHALL utilize the full width of the dashboard container
2. WHEN there are many columns THEN the horizontal scrolling SHALL be minimized due to increased available width
3. WHEN the table content exceeds the available width THEN horizontal scrolling SHALL still work properly
4. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the table SHALL still be responsive and functional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want consistent spacing and visual hierarchy, so that the interface remains clean and professional while maximizing content area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard displays statistics cards THEN they SHALL have appropriate spacing without excessive outer margins
2. WHEN the dashboard header is displayed THEN it SHALL have minimal padding while maintaining readability
3. WHEN multiple dashboard sections are shown THEN they SHALL have consistent internal spacing
4. WHEN the layout is optimized THEN the visual hierarchy SHALL remain clear and professional
