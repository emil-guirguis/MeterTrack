- ✅ should fail batch after 3 retry attempts
- ✅ should maintain cache state for failed batches

#### 10.3 Validation Error Handling (2 tests)
- ✅ should skip invalid readings and insert only valid ones
- ✅ should log validation errors for excluded readings

## Implementation Verification

### Core Features Verified

#### 1. Validation System ✅
- **Method:** `validateReadings()`
- **Validates:**
  - meter_id is not null
  - timestamp is valid Date and not in future
  - value is valid number (not null, NaN, or non-numeric)
  - data_point (field_name) is not empty
- **Returns:** ValidationResult with valid, invalid, skipped counts and error details

#### 2. Batch Generation and Execution ✅
- **Method:** `flushBatch()`
- **Features:**
  - Validates readings before insertion
  - Skips invalid readings from insertion
  - Logs validation errors
  - Splits readings into batches of 100 or fewer
  - Generates separate INSERT statement for each batch
  - Executes batches with transaction support

#### 3. Retry Logic ✅
- **Implementation:**
  - Retry failed batches up to 3 times
  - Wait 1 second before retry 2
  - Wait 2 seconds before retry 3
  - Retry attempts logged
  - Exponential backoff implemented

#### 4. Metrics Tracking ✅
- **Method:** `getInsertionMetrics()`
- **Tracks:**
  - Total readings processed
  - Successfully inserted count
  - Failed count
  - Skipped count (validation failures)
  - Retry attempts
  - Operation timestamp
  - Error messages from failed batches

#### 5. Transaction Management ✅
- **Implementation:**
  - Each batch executes within its own transaction
  - BEGIN transaction before batch INSERT
  - COMMIT on success
  - ROLLBACK on error
  - Transaction status logged

#### 6. Cache Management ✅
- **Implementation:**
  - Readings accumulated in memory during collection
  - Cache cleared after successful insertion
  - Cache state maintained for failed batches
  - Readings available for retry on next cycle

#### 7. Default Values ✅
- **Implementation:**
  - is_synchronized defaults to false for all readings
  - retry_count defaults to 0 for all readings
  - Both defaults applied in INSERT statement

## Code Quality Verification

### Type Safety ✅
- All required interfaces defined in `types.ts`:
  - `ValidationResult` - validation outcome
  - `ValidationError` - individual validation error details
  - `BatchInsertionResult` - insertion metrics and status
  - `PendingReading` - reading data structure

### Error Handling ✅
- Validation errors logged and tracked
- Database errors caught and retried
- Transaction rollback on error
- Error messages included in metrics

### Logging ✅
- Validation errors logged at debug level
- Batch insertion success logged at info level
- Retry attempts logged at warn level
- Final failures logged at error level

### Performance ✅
- Batch size optimization (100 readings per batch)
- Transaction support for atomicity
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Efficient cache management

## Test Execution Timeline

1. **Test Suite Initialization:** 148ms
2. **Setup:** 0ms
3. **Import:** 342ms
4. **Test Execution:** 10.08s
5. **Environment:** 0ms
6. **Total Duration:** 7.34s

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Verified:** All code changes maintain backward compatibility with existing meter collection functionality. No regressions detected in existing tests.

---

## Optional Property-Based Tests

As specified in the requirements, the following optional property-based tests (marked with `*`) were skipped for MVP:

- 2.2 Property test for validation logic
- 2.4 Unit tests for validation methods
- 3.3 Property test for batch splitting
- 3.5 Property test for retry logic
- 4.3 Property test for metrics accuracy
- 5.2 Property test for transaction atomicity
- 6.2 Property test for field_name mapping
- 7.3 Property test for default values
- 8.3 Property test for cache accumulation

These can be implemented in future iterations if needed.
