# Cleanup: Removed Unused MeterCollector Class

## Summary

Removed the unused `MeterCollector` class and all related code from the codebase. The system now exclusively uses `BACnetMeterReadingAgent` with `CollectionCycleManager` for meter reading operations.

## Files Deleted

1. **sync/mcp/src/meter-collection/collector.ts** - The unused MeterCollector class implementation
2. **sync/mcp/src/meter-collection/collector.test.ts** - Tests for the unused MeterCollector

## Files Modified

### sync/mcp/src/meter-collection/index.ts
- Removed exports for `MeterCollector`, `MeterConfig`, `MetersConfiguration`, `CollectorConfig`
- Now only exports BACnet-related types

### sync/mcp/src/index.ts
- Removed import of `MeterCollector` and `CollectorConfig`
- Removed `meterCollector` property from `SyncMcpServer` class
- Removed tool definitions for `start_collection` and `stop_collection`
- Removed handler methods:
  - `handleStartCollection()`
  - `handleStopCollection()`
- Updated `handleGetMeterStatus()` to use `BACnetMeterReadingAgent` instead of `MeterCollector`
- Removed meterCollector cleanup from `shutdown()` method
- Removed case statements for `start_collection` and `stop_collection` from tool router

## Why This Cleanup Was Needed

The `MeterCollector` class had a critical bug where it created an empty `dataPoints` array but never populated it with element-specific register numbers. This meant no meter readings were being collected through that path.

The actual working implementation is in:
- `BACnetMeterReadingAgent` - Orchestrates collection cycles
- `CollectionCycleManager` - Manages individual collection cycles
- `DeviceRegisterCache` - Caches device register configurations
- `MeterCache` - Caches meter information

These components correctly:
1. Load device registers from the cache
2. Build batch read requests for all configured registers
3. Read them from BACnet with adaptive batch sizing
4. Store readings with proper field_name mapping

## Available Tools After Cleanup

The following tools remain available for meter reading operations:

- `trigger_meter_reading` - Manually trigger an immediate BACnet meter reading collection cycle
- `get_meter_reading_status` - Get the current status of the BACnet meter reading agent
- `get_meter_status` - Get the connectivity and health status of meters (updated to use BACnetMeterReadingAgent)

The BACnet meter reading agent is automatically started and runs on a configurable schedule (default: 60 seconds).

## Verification

All TypeScript diagnostics pass with no errors or warnings after cleanup.
