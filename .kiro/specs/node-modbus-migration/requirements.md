# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing Modbus communication system from the `modbus-serial` library to `node-modbus` to support 50+ concurrent meter connections with improved TypeScript support, better performance, and enhanced connection management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Modbus system to handle 50+ concurrent meter connections reliably, so that I can scale the facility management system to monitor more devices without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system connects to 50+ Modbus devices simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain stable connections without timeouts or memory leaks
2. WHEN multiple meter readings are requested concurrently THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently using connection pooling
3. WHEN a connection fails THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect with exponential backoff strategy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want full TypeScript support for Modbus operations, so that I can write type-safe code with better IDE support and catch errors at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing Modbus client code THEN the system SHALL provide complete TypeScript type definitions
2. WHEN calling Modbus methods THEN the IDE SHALL provide accurate autocomplete and type checking
3. WHEN handling Modbus responses THEN the system SHALL enforce type safety for register data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want backward compatibility during the migration, so that existing meter configurations and data collection continue to work without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is in progress THEN existing meter readings SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN the new library is implemented THEN all existing register mappings SHALL work identically
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain the same error handling and logging patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved connection management, so that the system can efficiently handle multiple meter connections without resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple meters are accessed THEN the system SHALL reuse connections efficiently through connection pooling
2. WHEN connections are idle THEN the system SHALL manage connection lifecycle automatically
3. WHEN connection limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want comprehensive testing of the migration, so that I can ensure the new implementation works correctly before deploying to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing Modbus functionality SHALL be tested and verified
2. WHEN performance testing is conducted THEN the new implementation SHALL demonstrate improved performance over the old system
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN both MCP agent and backend API SHALL work correctly with the new library
