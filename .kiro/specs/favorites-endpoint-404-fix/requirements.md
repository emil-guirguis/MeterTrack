# Requirements Document: Favorites Endpoint 404 Fix

## Introduction

The `/api/favorites` endpoint is currently returning a 404 error when called from the frontend. This prevents users from loading their favorite items in the SidebarMetersSection component. The root cause is duplicate middleware application on the favorites route, where `authenticateToken` is applied both at the route handler level and globally at the server level.

## Glossary

- **Favorites_Endpoint**: The `/api/favorites` REST API endpoint that retrieves user favorites
- **authenticateToken**: Middleware that validates JWT tokens and verifies user authentication
- **Route_Handler**: The function that processes HTTP requests for a specific endpoint
- **Middleware**: Functions that process requests before they reach route handlers
- **Global_Middleware**: Middleware applied to all routes matching a pattern at the server level
- **Frontend**: The client-side application in `client/frontend/`
- **Backend**: The server-side application in `client/backend/`

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Duplicate Middleware

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate duplicate middleware application on the favorites route, so that the endpoint functions correctly without 404 errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Favorites_Endpoint route handler is examined, THE authenticateToken middleware SHALL be removed from the route handler definition
2. WHEN the Server setup is examined, THE authenticateToken middleware SHALL remain applied globally to the `/api/favorites` route pattern
3. WHEN a request is made to the Favorites_Endpoint after the fix, THE request SHALL pass through the global authenticateToken middleware exactly once
4. WHEN the Favorites_Endpoint receives a valid authenticated request, THE endpoint SHALL return a 200 status code instead of 404

### Requirement 2: Verify Endpoint Functionality

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the favorites endpoint to work correctly, so that the SidebarMetersSection component can load user favorites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend calls GET `/api/favorites?id1=1&id2=1`, THE Favorites_Endpoint SHALL process the request successfully
2. WHEN the Favorites_Endpoint processes a request, THE response SHALL contain the expected favorites data
3. WHEN the frontend receives a successful response from the Favorites_Endpoint, THE SidebarMetersSection component SHALL display the favorites without errors

### Requirement 3: Maintain Authentication Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want authentication to remain properly enforced, so that only authenticated users can access the favorites endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated request is made to the Favorites_Endpoint, THE global authenticateToken middleware SHALL reject the request
2. WHEN an unauthenticated request is rejected, THE Favorites_Endpoint SHALL return a 401 status code
3. WHEN a request with an invalid token is made to the Favorites_Endpoint, THE global authenticateToken middleware SHALL reject the request
4. WHEN an invalid token request is rejected, THE Favorites_Endpoint SHALL return a 401 status code
