# Diagnosis: Meter Reading Remote Upload Not Working

## Problem Statement

Meter readings are being collected from BACnet devices and stored in the sync database, but they are never appearing in the remote client database. The user reports: "i dont see the reading being uploaded to the remote client."

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps

1. **Checked Collection Flow**: ✅ Working
   - BACnet readings are collected successfully
   - Readings are inserted into sync database `meter_reading` table
   - Readings have `is_synchronized = false`

2. **Checked Upload Manager**: ✅ Implemented
   - `MeterReadingUploadManager` exists and is initialized
   - Retrieves unsynchronized readings from sync database
   - Attempts to upload via `ClientSystemApiClient`

3. **Checked API Client**: ✅ Implemented
   - `ClientSystemApiClient` makes HTTP POST to `/sync/readings/batch`
   - Formats readings correctly for API
   - Handles errors and retries

4. **Checked Client Backend API Endpoint**: ❌ **MISSING**
   - Searched for `/sync/readings/batch` endpoint
   - Searched for `uploadBatch` handler
   - **No endpoint found in client backend**

## Root Cause

**The API endpoint `/sync/readings/batch` does not exist in the client backend.**

The sync MCP is trying to upload readings to:
```
POST http://localhost:3001/api/sync/readings/batch
```

But this endpoint is not implemented in `client/backend/src/routes/`.

## Evidence

1. **MeterReadingUploadManager** (sync/mcp/src/bacnet-collection/meter-reading-upload-manager.ts):
   - Line 145: Calls `this.apiClient.uploadBatch(readings)`
   - Expects successful response

2. **ClientSystemApiClient** (sync/mcp/src/api/client-system-api.ts):
   - Line 108: Makes POST to `/sync/readings/batch`
   - Expects `BatchUploadResponse` with `success` flag

3. **Client Backend Routes** (client/backend/src/routes/):
   - No `/sync/readings/batch` endpoint
   - No sync-related routes found

## Solution

Implement the missing API endpoint in the client backend:

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/sync/readings/batch`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "readings": [
    {
      "meter_id": 123,
      "timestamp": "2024-01-17T10:30:00Z",
      "data_point": "field_name",
      "value": 42.5,
      "unit": "kWh"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "recordsProcessed": 1,
  "message": "Batch uploaded successfully"
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
1. Validate API key from request headers
2. Validate tenant_id from authenticated user
3. Insert readings into client database `meter_reading` table
4. Return success/failure response

## Next Steps

1. Create spec for implementing the missing API endpoint
2. Implement the endpoint in client backend
3. Test end-to-end upload flow
4. Verify readings appear in client database
