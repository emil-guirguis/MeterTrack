# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to run in a separate thread from the main application, improving performance, responsiveness, and system reliability. By decoupling the MCP server operations from the main application thread, we can prevent blocking operations and enable better resource management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to run in a separate thread, so that the main application remains responsive even during intensive MCP operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the MCP server in a separate thread
2. WHEN the MCP server is processing requests THEN the main application thread SHALL remain unblocked
3. WHEN the MCP server encounters errors THEN the main application SHALL continue to function normally
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL gracefully terminate the MCP server thread

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper communication between the main application and the MCP server thread, so that data can be exchanged safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main application needs to send data to the MCP server THEN the system SHALL use thread-safe communication mechanisms
2. WHEN the MCP server needs to send responses back THEN the system SHALL queue responses for the main thread to process
3. WHEN multiple requests are made simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle them without race conditions
4. WHEN communication fails between threads THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt recovery

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want monitoring and health checks for the MCP server thread, so that I can ensure it's running properly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server thread is running THEN the system SHALL provide health status information
2. WHEN the MCP server thread becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL detect this condition within 30 seconds
3. WHEN thread health checks fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN the MCP server thread crashes THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic restart with exponential backoff

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable thread management options, so that I can optimize performance for different deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to specify thread pool size for MCP operations
2. WHEN under high load THEN the system SHALL be able to spawn additional worker threads up to the configured maximum
3. WHEN load decreases THEN the system SHALL reduce the number of active threads to conserve resources
4. WHEN thread limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them as threads become available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper resource cleanup and memory management, so that the threaded MCP server doesn't cause memory leaks or resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN threads complete their work THEN the system SHALL properly clean up allocated resources
2. WHEN the application runs for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable
3. WHEN threads are terminated THEN all associated file handles and network connections SHALL be closed
4. WHEN the system is under memory pressure THEN the MCP server SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms
