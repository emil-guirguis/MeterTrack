# Sync Connection Status Display Fix

## Problem
The Sync Frontend was displaying "Disconnected" in the System Connection card even when the system was actually connected and functioning properly.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a disconnect between the **Connectivity Monitor** and the **Sync Manager**:

1. **Connectivity Monitor** was running independently and tracking connection state in its private `status.isConnected` field
2. **Sync Manager** was maintaining its own `isClientConnected` flag that was only updated during sync operations or explicit connectivity checks
3. The Sync Manager's connectivity check was doing a separate API call instead of using the Connectivity Monitor's already-tracked state
4. The frontend was reading the Sync Manager's status, which wasn't being kept in sync with the actual connectivity monitor

## Solution
Made three key changes to synchronize the connectivity state:

### 1. Exposed Connectivity Monitor State (connectivity-monitor.ts)
Added a method to allow the Sync Manager to access the current connection state:
```typescript
getInternalStatus(): ConnectivityStatus {
  return { ...this.status };
}
```

### 2. Updated Sync Manager to Use Monitor State (sync-manager.ts)
Changed `checkClientConnectivity()` to use the Connectivity Monitor's state instead of doing a separate check:
```typescript
private async checkClientConnectivity(): Promise<boolean> {
  // Use the connectivity monitor's current state instead of doing a separate check
  const isConnected = this.connectivityMonitor.isConnected();
  this.status.isClientConnected = isConnected;
  return isConnected;
}
```

### 3. Updated Event Handlers (sync-manager.ts)
Modified the connectivity event handlers to immediately update the Sync Manager's status:
```typescript
this.connectivityMonitor.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('Connectivity restored - auto-resuming sync');
  this.status.isClientConnected = true;  // ← Added this line
  this.performSync();
});

this.connectivityMonitor.on('disconnected', () => {
  console.log('Connectivity lost - readings will be queued');
  this.status.isClientConnected = false;  // ← Added this line
});
```

## Result
- The Connectivity Monitor continuously checks connection status every 60 seconds
- When connectivity changes, the Sync Manager is immediately notified via events
- The Sync Manager's status is always in sync with the actual connectivity state
- The frontend receives accurate connection status from the API
- The System Connection card now displays the correct status

## Files Modified
- `sync/mcp/src/api/connectivity-monitor.ts` - Added method to expose internal status
- `sync/mcp/src/sync-service/sync-manager.ts` - Updated to use monitor state and handle events

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Start the sync system
2. Check the System Connection card - should show "Connected" if the Client System is reachable
3. Stop the Client System
4. Wait up to 60 seconds for the next connectivity check
5. The card should update to show "Disconnected"
6. Restart the Client System
7. The card should update back to "Connected" within 60 seconds
