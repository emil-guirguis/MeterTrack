# Requirements Document: Comprehensive Dependency Cleanup

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for auditing and removing unused libraries, npm packages, services, utilities, and components across the entire MeterIt solution. The solution consists of multiple workspaces (client backend/frontend/mcp, sync mcp/frontend, and framework frontend/backend) with interdependencies. The goal is to reduce technical debt, improve maintainability, reduce bundle sizes, and eliminate orphaned code while ensuring all builds succeed and functionality is preserved.

## Glossary

- **Workspace**: A directory containing a package.json and source code (e.g., client/backend, client/frontend, sync/mcp)
- **Dependency**: An npm package listed in package.json (production or dev)
- **Unused Dependency**: An npm package in package.json that is not imported or used anywhere in the codebase
- **Unused Code**: Source files, components, hooks, utilities, or services that are not imported by any active code
- **Orphaned Code**: Code files that exist but have no references from other parts of the system
- **Import**: A reference to a module, component, or utility via import/require statements
- **Active Code**: Code that is directly or transitively imported by entry points or active modules
- **Entry Point**: The main file that starts execution (e.g., src/server.js, src/main.tsx, dist/index.js)
- **Transitive Dependency**: A dependency required by another dependency
- **Peer Dependency**: A dependency that should be provided by the consuming package
- **Dev Dependency**: A dependency only needed during development or testing
- **Production Dependency**: A dependency needed at runtime

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Audit All npm Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to audit all npm packages across all workspaces, so that I can identify which packages are actually being used in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit begins, THE System SHALL scan all package.json files in the following workspaces:
   - Root package.json
   - client/backend/package.json
   - client/frontend/package.json
   - client/mcp/package.json
   - sync/mcp/package.json
   - sync/frontend/package.json
   - framework/frontend/package.json

2. WHEN scanning dependencies, THE System SHALL categorize each package as:
   - Production dependency (in dependencies)
   - Development dependency (in devDependencies)
   - Peer dependency (in peerDependencies)

3. WHEN analyzing each dependency, THE System SHALL determine if it is:
   - Directly imported in source code
   - Transitively required by other dependencies
   - Only used in configuration files or build scripts
   - Completely unused

4. WHEN the audit completes, THE System SHALL generate a report listing:
   - All dependencies by workspace
   - Usage status for each dependency (used/unused)
   - Reason for usage or reason for being unused
   - Estimated impact of removal (bundle size, functionality)

### Requirement 2: Identify Unused npm Packages

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify which npm packages are not being used, so that I can remove them and reduce dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing imports, THE System SHALL scan all TypeScript, JavaScript, and JSX files for import/require statements

2. WHEN checking for usage, THE System SHALL verify that each dependency is:
   - Imported in at least one source file, OR
   - Required by another dependency, OR
   - Explicitly needed for build/runtime configuration

3. WHEN a package is not found in any imports, THE System SHALL mark it as unused and note:
   - The workspace where it appears
   - Whether it's a production or dev dependency
   - Any configuration files that reference it

4. WHEN the analysis completes, THE System SHALL provide a list of unused packages grouped by workspace

### Requirement 3: Identify Unused Source Code Files and Modules

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify unused source files, components, hooks, and utilities, so that I can remove orphaned code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning source code, THE System SHALL identify all TypeScript, JavaScript, JSX, and TSX files in src/ directories

2. WHEN analyzing imports, THE System SHALL build a dependency graph showing which files import which other files

   - Imported by at least one other file, OR
   - An entry point (server.js, main.tsx, index.ts), OR
   - Exported from an index file that is imported elsewhere

4. WHEN a file is not referenced, THE System SHALL mark it as unused and note:
   - The workspace where it exists
   - The file path
   - Any files that might have previously imported it

5. WHEN the analysis completes, THE System SHALL provide a list of unused files grouped by workspace and type (components, hooks, utilities, services)

### Requirement 4: Identify Unused Services and Utilities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify unused backend services and utility modules, so that I can remove unnecessary code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

   - Exported from an index file that is imported
   - Completely unused

5. WHEN the analysis completes, THE System SHALL provide a categorized list of unused services and utilities

   - Imported by components or other hooks
   - Exported from an index file that is imported
   - Completely unused

5. WHEN the analysis completes, THE System SHALL provide a list of unused components and hooks grouped by workspace
