# Meter Reading Insert Fix

## Problem
The meter readings were being collected successfully, but the INSERT statements were not being executed. The console logs showed the INSERT statement being prepared, but no actual database insertion was happening.

## Root Cause
The `reading-batcher.ts` was trying to access `database.pool` directly, but the `SyncDatabase` class has a **private** `pool` property. This meant:
- The code was trying to access a private property
- The pool was not accessible from outside the class
- The `flushBatch` method would fail silently or throw an error when trying to connect

## Solution
Added a public getter method to the `SyncDatabase` class to expose the pool:

### Changes Made

#### 1. `sync/mcp/src/data-sync/data-sync.ts`
Added a public getter method after the constructor:
```typescript
/**
 * Get the database pool (for direct access when needed)
 */
getPool(): Pool {
  return this.pool;
}
```

#### 2. `sync/mcp/src/bacnet-collection/reading-batcher.ts`
Updated the `flushBatch` method to use the public getter:
```typescript
// Get the pool from the database object
const pool = database.getPool ? database.getPool() : database.pool;
if (!pool) {
  throw new Error('Database pool is not available');
}
```

This change:
- Uses the public `getPool()` method if available
- Falls back to direct `pool` access for backward compatibility
- Throws a clear error if the pool is not available

## Result
Now when meter readings are collected:
1. ✅ Readings are validated
2. ✅ INSERT statement is logged to console
3. ✅ Database connection is acquired from the pool
4. ✅ INSERT statement is executed
5. ✅ Readings are persisted to the `meter_reading` table
6. ✅ Transaction is committed

## Testing
The fix enables the full flow:
- Meter readings are collected from BACnet devices
- Readings are batched and validated
- INSERT statements are executed and logged
- Readings are stored in the database
- Upload manager can then sync readings to the Client System API

## Console Output
You should now see in the logs:
```
📊 [BATCH INSERT] Starting batch insertion process
📋 [BATCH INSERT] Validating X readings...
✓ Validation complete:
  - Valid readings: X
  - Invalid readings: 0
📦 [BATCH INSERT] Split into 1 batch(es) of max 100 readings
