# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a company collection in the meterdb database and connect it to the existing company settings tab in the frontend. Currently, the frontend has a comprehensive company settings interface with mock data, but it needs to be connected to a real database collection to persist company information and settings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want company settings to be stored in a database collection, so that company information persists across application restarts and can be managed centrally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create a company collection in the meterdb database if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN company settings are updated through the frontend THEN the system SHALL persist the changes to the database collection
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve company settings from the database instead of using mock data
4. WHEN no company settings exist in the database THEN the system SHALL create default company settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to update company information through the settings interface, so that I can maintain accurate company details and branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I update company name, logo, or contact information THEN the system SHALL save the changes to the database
2. WHEN I update branding settings like colors and logos THEN the system SHALL persist the branding configuration
3. WHEN I modify system configuration settings THEN the system SHALL store the updated configuration in the database
4. WHEN I save settings THEN the system SHALL validate the data before persisting to the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the company settings to be linked between the frontend and backend, so that changes are reflected immediately and consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives a settings update request THEN the system SHALL update the database and return the updated settings
2. WHEN the frontend requests company settings THEN the system SHALL retrieve the current settings from the database
3. WHEN settings are updated THEN the system SHALL return appropriate success or error responses
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the frontend

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the company settings API to follow RESTful conventions, so that it integrates seamlessly with the existing application architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the API THEN the system SHALL provide GET /api/settings/company endpoint for retrieving settings
2. WHEN implementing the API THEN the system SHALL provide PUT /api/settings/company endpoint for updating settings
3. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL require proper authentication and authorization
4. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL follow the existing error handling patterns in the application

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database schema to support all existing company settings features, so that no functionality is lost when migrating from mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the database schema THEN the system SHALL support all fields defined in the CompanySettings interface
2. WHEN storing company settings THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and validation
3. WHEN querying company settings THEN the system SHALL return data in the format expected by the frontend
4. WHEN the collection is created THEN the system SHALL include appropriate indexes for performance
