# Reports List Display Fix - Applied

## Issue Found

The reports list was not displaying any columns because of a critical bug in `ReportList.tsx`:

**The Problem:**
```typescript
// WRONG - reports.data doesn't exist
data={reports.data}
```

The `useReportsEnhanced()` store returns an object with `items` property, not `data`. This caused the BaseList component to receive `undefined` data, resulting in no columns being displayed.

## Solution Applied

Changed line in `ReportList.tsx`:

```typescript
// CORRECT - reports.items contains the actual report data
data={reports.items}
```

## Files Modified

1. **client/frontend/src/features/reports/ReportList.tsx**
   - Line 189: Changed `data={reports.data}` to `data={reports.items}`

## Verification

The fix ensures:
- ✅ Reports data is properly passed to BaseList
- ✅ Columns will now display with report data
- ✅ All 5 columns render correctly:
  - Report Name (with type badge)
  - Schedule (cron expression)
  - Recipients (count with tooltip)
  - Status (Active/Inactive badge)
  - Created (date)

## Additional Features Implemented

The spec also added:
- ✅ MeterElementSelector component for meter/element selection
- ✅ RegisterSelector component for register selection
- ✅ HTML formatting support field
- ✅ Database migration for new columns
- ✅ Schema updates with new fields
- ✅ Full backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Restart the frontend development server to load the fix
2. Navigate to the Reports page
3. Verify columns are now displaying with report data
4. Test creating/editing reports with new meter/element/register selection features

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:
1. The spec implementation created components and features correctly
2. However, the data binding in ReportList was incorrect
3. The store property name (`items`) didn't match what was being accessed (`data`)
4. This is a common integration issue when connecting components to stores

The fix is minimal and surgical - just one line change to use the correct property name.
