# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an email template management system that allows users to create, manage, and use email templates for automated notifications. The system includes default templates for meter reading notifications and supports variable substitution for personalized communications. The initial implementation focuses on three key notification types: total meter readings for the last 30 days, meter error notifications when meters are not responding, and maintenance reminder notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage email templates, so that I can create consistent branded communications for different notification types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing email templates THEN the system SHALL display a list of templates with name, subject, category, and usage count
2. WHEN creating a template THEN the system SHALL require name, subject, content, and category fields
3. WHEN editing a template THEN the system SHALL allow updating all template fields including content and variables
4. WHEN deleting a template THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if the template is currently in use
5. WHEN saving a template THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and template syntax

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want default email templates for meter notifications, so that I can quickly send standardized communications about meter status and readings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN the system SHALL create three default email templates
2. WHEN creating default templates THEN the system SHALL include "Total Meter Reading (30 Days)" template with meter reading summary variables
3. WHEN creating default templates THEN the system SHALL include "Meter Not Responding" template with error details and troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN creating default templates THEN the system SHALL include "Meter Maintenance Reminder" template with maintenance schedule information
5. WHEN using default templates THEN the system SHALL support variable substitution for meter-specific data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a communications manager, I want to use template variables, so that I can personalize email content with dynamic data from the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a template THEN the system SHALL support variable placeholders in the format {{variable_name}}
2. WHEN editing template content THEN the system SHALL provide a list of available variables for the template category
3. WHEN previewing a template THEN the system SHALL show rendered content with sample data substituted for variables
4. WHEN sending emails using templates THEN the system SHALL replace all variables with actual data values
5. IF a variable is missing data THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with default values or empty strings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a meter technician, I want automated email notifications for meter issues, so that I can respond quickly to problems and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a meter stops responding THEN the system SHALL automatically send "Meter Not Responding" notification using the default template
2. WHEN generating meter reading summaries THEN the system SHALL use "Total Meter Reading (30 Days)" template with actual reading data
3. WHEN maintenance is due THEN the system SHALL send "Meter Maintenance Reminder" using the maintenance template
4. WHEN sending automated emails THEN the system SHALL log email delivery status and any errors
5. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry sending with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to preview email templates before sending, so that I can verify the content and formatting are correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN previewing a template THEN the system SHALL render the template with sample data for all variables
2. WHEN previewing THEN the system SHALL display both HTML and plain text versions if available
3. WHEN previewing THEN the system SHALL show the final subject line with variables substituted
4. WHEN previewing THEN the system SHALL highlight any missing or invalid variables
5. WHEN satisfied with preview THEN the system SHALL allow proceeding to send the email

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track email template usage, so that I can understand which templates are most valuable and optimize communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an email is sent using a template THEN the system SHALL increment the template usage counter
2. WHEN viewing template statistics THEN the system SHALL display usage count, last used date, and success rate
3. WHEN analyzing template performance THEN the system SHALL track delivery success, open rates, and error rates
4. WHEN templates are unused THEN the system SHALL identify templates that haven't been used in the last 90 days
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide template usage analytics and trends
