# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Remove MongoDB device model dependencies





  - Remove MongoDB Devices model file and all imports
  - Update any remaining code that references the MongoDB model
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Create database migration script for brands to devices





  - [x] 2.1 Create migration script to copy brands data to devices table


    - Write SQL script to transfer brands.name → devices.name and brands.model → devices.description
    - Handle duplicate names by appending model information
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_
  
  - [x] 2.2 Create script to update meter device_id references


    - Update all meters table device_id foreign keys to reference new device records
    - Maintain referential integrity during the migration
    - _Requirements: 5.3_
  
  - [ ]* 2.3 Add migration validation and rollback functionality
    - Create validation queries to verify migration success
    - Implement rollback procedures if migration fails
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 3. Update MeterPG model to use devices table




  - [x] 3.1 Modify database queries to join with devices instead of brands


    - Update findById and findAll methods to join with devices table
    - Change brand_name and brand_model references to device fields
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
  
  - [x] 3.2 Update response field mapping for device information


    - Ensure meter responses include proper device details from devices table
    - Update field names to match new device schema
    - _Requirements: 4.3_
-

- [x] 4. Update meters API routes to reference devices table




  - [x] 4.1 Modify meter creation logic to use devices table


    - Update device lookup and creation logic in POST /meters
    - Replace brands table references with devices table operations
    - _Requirements: 4.1_
  
  - [x] 4.2 Update meter update logic to maintain device relationships


    - Modify PUT /meters/:id to properly handle device associations
    - Ensure referential integrity with devices table
    - _Requirements: 4.2_

- [x] 5. Add validation and error handling improvements





  - [x] 5.1 Enhance DeviceService input validation


    - Add comprehensive validation for device name and description fields
    - Implement proper error messages for constraint violations
    - _Requirements: 1.3_
  
  - [x] 5.2 Improve device API error responses


    - Standardize error response format across all device endpoints
    - Add specific error codes for different failure scenarios
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [-] 6. Add comprehensive testing




  - [ ]* 6.1 Write unit tests for DeviceService methods



    - Test CRUD operations with various input scenarios
    - Test error handling and validation logic
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_
  
  - [ ]* 6.2 Write integration tests for device API endpoints
    - Test all device endpoints with valid and invalid data
    - Verify proper error responses and status codes
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
  
  - [ ]* 6.3 Write tests for meter-device relationship functionality
    - Test meter creation and updates with device associations
    - Verify referential integrity is maintained
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Execute database migration and verify system integrity





  - [x] 7.1 Run the brands to devices migration script


    - Execute the migration in a controlled environment
    - Monitor for any data integrity issues during migration
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_
  
  - [x] 7.2 Verify all device and meter operations work correctly


    - Test device CRUD operations through API
    - Test meter operations with device associations
    - Confirm frontend functionality remains intact
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
