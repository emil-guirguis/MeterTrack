# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that the sidebar header remains visible and accessible in the app header when the browser window is shrunk or on mobile devices. This enhancement improves navigation accessibility by guaranteeing users can always access the menu toggle and primary navigation controls, regardless of screen size or browser window dimensions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to see the sidebar header in the app header when my screen is small, so that I can always access the navigation menu.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser width is below tablet breakpoint (768px) THEN the system SHALL display the sidebar header content in the main app header
2. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed on mobile THEN the system SHALL show the menu toggle button prominently in the app header
3. WHEN the user taps the menu toggle THEN the system SHALL open the navigation menu overlay or drawer
4. WHEN the sidebar header is shown in app header THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent branding and styling
5. WHEN transitioning between screen sizes THEN the system SHALL smoothly move sidebar header elements without layout jumps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with a narrow browser window, I want the sidebar header to remain accessible when I resize my browser, so that I don't lose navigation functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser window is resized below the sidebar threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically move sidebar header to app header
2. WHEN the browser window is expanded above the threshold THEN the system SHALL restore sidebar header to its original position
3. WHEN the window is being resized THEN the system SHALL maintain header functionality without flickering or broken states
4. WHEN the sidebar header is in the app header THEN the system SHALL preserve all interactive elements and their functionality
5. WHEN switching between desktop and mobile layouts THEN the system SHALL maintain user context and navigation state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want consistent access to primary navigation controls, so that I can efficiently navigate the application regardless of screen constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application on any screen size THEN the system SHALL always display a menu access control
2. WHEN the menu control is activated THEN the system SHALL provide access to all authorized navigation options
3. WHEN navigation is accessed via mobile header THEN the system SHALL show the same menu items as desktop sidebar
4. WHEN the user navigates to a new page THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate header state for the current screen size
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL immediately show the correct header configuration for the current viewport

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the mobile navigation header to be fully accessible, so that I can navigate using assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels for mobile navigation controls
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support tab navigation through mobile header elements
3. WHEN the menu toggle is focused THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual focus indicators
4. WHEN the mobile menu is opened THEN the system SHALL manage focus appropriately and announce state changes
5. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios for all header elements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the responsive header behavior to be performant and maintainable, so that the application remains fast and the code is sustainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen size changes THEN the system SHALL use efficient CSS media queries and avoid JavaScript-heavy solutions
2. WHEN the component renders THEN the system SHALL minimize layout recalculations and repaints
3. WHEN implementing responsive behavior THEN the system SHALL use semantic HTML and maintain component modularity
4. WHEN the header state changes THEN the system SHALL update efficiently without unnecessary re-renders
5. WHEN debugging responsive issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear component boundaries and predictable behavior
