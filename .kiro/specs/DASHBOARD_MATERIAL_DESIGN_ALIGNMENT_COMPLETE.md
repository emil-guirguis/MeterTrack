# Dashboard Material Design Alignment - Complete

## Summary

Successfully updated the dashboard and dashboard form settings components to follow Google Material Design 3 specifications using Material-UI (MUI) components.

## Changes Made

### 1. DashboardCard Component (`client/frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardCard.tsx`)

**Replaced custom HTML with Material-UI components:**
- `<div className="dashboard-card">` → `<Card>` with MUI styling
- `<h3>` title → `<Typography variant="h6">` with Material Design typography
- Custom action buttons → `<Button>` components with icons (RefreshIcon, EditIcon, DeleteIcon, FullscreenIcon)
- Custom metadata section → Material Design layout with `<Box>` and `<Typography>`
- Custom select dropdowns → `<Select>` and `<MenuItem>` components
- Custom loading spinner → `<CircularProgress>` component
- Custom error display → `<Alert>` component
- Custom value cards → `<Paper>` components with Material Design elevation
- Custom daily totals list → Material Design list with `<Divider>` components

**Key improvements:**
- Uses MUI theme colors (primary, secondary, error) instead of hardcoded colors
- Implements Material Design elevation system with proper shadows
- Responsive design using `useMediaQuery` hook
- Proper focus states and accessibility patterns
- Consistent spacing and typography following Material Design guidelines
- Ripple effects on buttons (built-in with MUI Button)

### 2. DashboardCardModal Component (`client/frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardCardModal.tsx`)

**Replaced custom modal with Material-UI Dialog:**
- `<Modal>` (custom) → `<Dialog>` component
- Custom form layout → Material Design form with proper spacing
- Custom text inputs → `<TextField>` components with outlined variant
- Custom select dropdowns → `<Select>` and `<MenuItem>` components
- Custom checkboxes → `<Checkbox>` and `<FormControlLabel>` components
- Custom error messages → `<FormHelperText>` with error styling
- Custom buttons → `<Button>` components with proper variants
- Custom loading state → `<CircularProgress>` component

**Key improvements:**
- Full-screen dialog on mobile devices using `useMediaQuery`
- Proper form validation with Material Design error styling
- Consistent field spacing and typography
- Material Design form layout with proper label positioning
- Loading indicators using MUI CircularProgress
- Responsive grid layout for date range fields

## Material Design Features Implemented
