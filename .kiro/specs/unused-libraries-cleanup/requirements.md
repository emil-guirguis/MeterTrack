# Requirements Document: Unused Libraries Cleanup

## Introduction

This feature involves systematically auditing and removing all unused npm packages, services, utilities, and code modules from the solution. The cleanup will reduce dependencies, improve build times, and simplify maintenance. The audit spans all workspaces: client/backend, client/frontend, client/mcp, sync/mcp, sync/frontend, and framework/frontend.

## Glossary

- **npm Package**: JavaScript library dependency declared in package.json
- **Unused Package**: A package declared in package.json but not imported anywhere in the codebase
- **Dead Code**: Code files that are not imported or used by any other module
- **Orphaned Import**: An import statement that references a deleted or non-existent module
- **Workspace**: A separate project directory with its own package.json (client/backend, client/frontend, etc.)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Unused npm Packages from Backend

**User Story:** As a backend maintainer, I want to remove unused npm packages, so that the backend has fewer external dependencies and faster installation times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm install is run in client/backend, THE Backend SHALL NOT install packages that are not imported in the codebase
2. THE Backend package.json SHALL remove all unused dependencies identified in the audit
3. WHEN the backend is built, THE Build SHALL NOT fail due to missing imports
4. THE Backend SHALL maintain all actively used dependencies

### Requirement 2: Remove Unused npm Packages from Frontend

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to remove unused npm packages, so that the frontend bundle is smaller and builds faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm install is run in client/frontend, THE Frontend SHALL NOT install packages that are not imported in the codebase
2. THE Frontend package.json SHALL remove all unused dependencies identified in the audit
3. WHEN the frontend is built, THE Build SHALL NOT fail due to missing imports
4. THE Frontend Bundle Size SHALL be reduced by removing unused packages

### Requirement 3: Remove Unused npm Packages from MCP Servers

**User Story:** As an MCP maintainer, I want to remove unused npm packages from MCP servers, so that MCP servers have minimal dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm install is run in client/mcp, THE Client MCP SHALL NOT install unused packages
2. WHEN npm install is run in sync/mcp, THE Sync MCP SHALL NOT install unused packages
3. THE MCP package.json files SHALL remove all unused dependencies
4. WHEN MCP servers start, THE Servers SHALL NOT fail due to missing imports

### Requirement 4: Remove Unused npm Packages from Framework

**User Story:** As a framework maintainer, I want to remove unused npm packages from the framework, so that the framework has minimal dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm install is run in framework/frontend, THE Framework SHALL NOT install unused packages
2. THE Framework package.json SHALL remove all unused dependencies
3. WHEN the framework is built, THE Build SHALL NOT fail due to missing imports
4. THE Framework peerDependencies SHALL remain accurate

### Requirement 5: Remove Dead Code Files

**User Story:** As a code quality maintainer, I want to remove dead code files that are not imported anywhere, so that the codebase is cleaner and easier to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is analyzed, THE Analysis SHALL identify all files that are not imported by any other module
2. THE Dead Code Files SHALL be removed from the codebase
3. WHEN the codebase is built, THE Build SHALL NOT fail due to missing imports
4. THE Codebase Size SHALL be reduced by removing dead code

### Requirement 6: Ensure No Broken Imports Remain

**User Story:** As a code quality maintainer, I want to ensure no broken imports remain after cleanup, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is analyzed, THE Linter SHALL report no errors related to missing imports
2. WHEN the codebase is type-checked, THE TypeScript Compiler SHALL report no errors related to undefined references
3. THE Build Process SHALL complete successfully without warnings about missing modules
4. WHEN the application starts, THE Application SHALL NOT throw errors related to missing code

### Requirement 7: Verify All Builds Succeed

**User Story:** As a build maintainer, I want to verify that all builds succeed after cleanup, so that the removal doesn't introduce regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is built, THE Build SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN the backend is built, THE Build SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN the MCP servers are built, THE Builds SHALL complete successfully
4. WHEN the framework is built, THE Build SHALL complete successfully

### Requirement 8: Verify Application Functionality

**User Story:** As a QA maintainer, I want to verify that application functionality is preserved after cleanup, so that the removal doesn't introduce regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts, THE Application SHALL start successfully without errors
2. WHEN the frontend is used, THE Frontend SHALL function correctly with all features working
3. WHEN the backend is used, THE Backend SHALL function correctly with all endpoints working
4. WHEN the MCP servers are used, THE Servers SHALL function correctly with all tools working
